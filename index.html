    <p class="caption-text">Photographer: Susannah</p>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to our group portfolio for Communications 465. We have all been
        working together the entire
        semester
        on various projects we have been assigned for class. We have done tech breakdowns for local businesses, as well
        as
        studies on enterprise applications. We have learned a lot about various ways to communicate with tech through
        COMM 465!

        <h2>Breakout Session # 1
        </h2>
        <img class="pic-bakery" src="images/bagel_bakery.jpg" alt="some bagels">
        <p>
            We did our work on the breakout session with bagel bakery as Susannah is their social media manager.
            We wanted to see
            how we could use technology to improve their business model. We spoke with their manager and
            brainstormed to think of
            some ideas we could implement into their business. We came up with a few changes to make to the
            website and implementing
            a new feature that the manager had been looking to implement for a while, an accurate bagel timer
            for when the bagels
            would be done. To implement this Jeremy wrote a bit of JavaScript code himself to pull this off to
            the specifics that
            the manager wanted. He also wrote some custom html and CSS code to properly embed the social medias
            into the site as
            well as just spicing up the site design overall. Here is a link to the site with the timer feature
            included.

        <img class="pic-rek" src="images/Reflektive___Logo.jpg" alt="Reflektive Logo">
        <p>
            Here we analyzed an employee feedback tool called Reflektive and gauged about the pros and cons of
            the software. We
            found that for a business-like bagel bakery that is a mom and Pop that this software would not
            really be a good fit. In
            general, we also found that we had more grievances with the software than we had pros. For the
            second part of the
            project, we all picked a job description for our careers of choice and also talked about the job
            description in
            reference to our resumes. This was a good exercise as many of us are about to be entering the
            job-hunting phase.

            <h2>Jeremy & Matt : Wearables
            </h2>
            <img class="pic-watch" src="images/apple_watch.jpg" alt="apple watch">
            <p>Jeremy and Matt chose to do the topic of wearable smart devices for their tech
                dive
                project. They compared the current
                state of the market right now. The three major players are Fitbit Wear OS (Android) and Apple.
                Overall,
                they concluded
                that each category works best for different types of people. Fitbit works better for users that
                are only
                focused on
                exercise, don’t have a strong opinion about the apple or android ecosystem and / or aren’t very
                technologically
                literate. For Wear OS / android watches, we found that this could be better for more
                technologically
                savvy users that
                enjoy the android and google play ecosystem and additionally enjoy the extra options the android
                market
                gives them.
                Finally, the apple watch supports the average user the most, although pricey like most apple
                products,
                it supports full
                integration into the apple ecosystem and allows you to check messages. Music playlists calls
                etc. all
                while also
                recording fitness stats. We found that apple has the largest share in the market right now and
                that
                things will probably
                stay that way for a long time.

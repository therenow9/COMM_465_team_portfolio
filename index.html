    <h1>About Us
    </h1>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to our group portfolio for Communications 465. We have all been working together the entire
        semester
        on various projects we have been assigned for class. We have done tech breakdowns for local businesses, as well
        as
        studies on enterprise applications. We have learned a lot about various ways to communicate with tech through
        COMM 465!

                <p>
                    We did our work on the breakout session with bagel bakery as Susannah is their social media manager.
                    We wanted to see
                    how we could use technology to improve their business model. We spoke with their manager and
                    brainstormed to think of
                    some ideas we could implement into their business. We came up with a few changes to make to the
                    website and implementing
                    a new feature that the manager had been looking to implement for a while, an accurate bagel timer
                    for when the bagels
                    would be done. To implement this Jeremy wrote a bit of JavaScript code himself to pull this off to
                    the specifics that
                    the manager wanted. He also wrote some custom html and CSS code to properly embed the social medias
                    into the site as
                    well as just spicing up the site design overall. Here is a link to the site with the timer feature
                    included.

                <p>
                    Here we analyzed an employee feedback tool called Reflektive and gauged about the pros and cons of
                    the software. We
                    found that for a business-like bagel bakery that is a mom and Pop that this software would not
                    really be a good fit. In
                    general, we also found that we had more grievances with the software than we had pros. For the
                    second part of the
                    project, we all picked a job description for our careers of choice and also talked about the job
                    description in
                    reference to our resumes. This was a good exercise as many of us are about to be entering the
                    job-hunting phase.

                    </h2>
                    <img class="pic-watch" src="images/apple_watch.jpg" alt="apple watch">
                    <p>Jeremy and Matt chose to do the topic of wearable smart devices for their tech
                        dive
                        project. They compared the current
                        state of the market right now. The three major players are Fitbit Wear OS (Android) and Apple.
                        Overall,
                        they concluded
                        that each category works best for different types of people. Fitbit works better for users that
                        are only
                        focused on
                        exercise, don’t have a strong opinion about the apple or android ecosystem and / or aren’t very
                        technologically
                        literate. For Wear OS / android watches, we found that this could be better for more
                        technologically
                        savvy users that
                        enjoy the android and google play ecosystem and additionally enjoy the extra options the android
                        market
                        gives them.
                        Finally, the apple watch supports the average user the most, although pricey like most apple
                        products,
                        it supports full
                        integration into the apple ecosystem and allows you to check messages. Music playlists calls
                        etc. all
                        while also
                        recording fitness stats. We found that apple has the largest share in the market right now and
                        that
                        things will probably
                        stay that way for a long time.
